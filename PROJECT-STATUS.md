# Real-Time Fraud Detection System - Project Overview

## ✅ Implementation Status

### Core Components - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] **Gradle Build System**: Multi-module project with JavaFX and Kafka dependencies
- [x] **Data Models**: Transaction and FraudAlert POJOs with JSON serialization
- [x] **Kafka Configuration**: Producer/Consumer setup with topic management
- [x] **Transaction Simulator**: Alpaca-style stock transaction generator
- [x] **Fraud Detection Service**: Real-time rule-based fraud detection engine
- [x] **JavaFX UI**: Live dashboard with transaction and alert visualization
- [x] **Infrastructure Scripts**: Kafka startup/shutdown automation
- [x] **Application Orchestration**: Complete system startup/shutdown scripts

### Key Features Implemented ✅

- **Real-time Stream Processing**: Kafka-based event streaming
- **Distributed Architecture**: Multiple services communicating via message queues
- **Fraud Detection Rules**:
  - High-value transaction detection (>$100k)
  - Account velocity monitoring (>5 transactions/second)
  - Off-hours trading detection
  - Rapid-fire transaction patterns
- **Live Visualization**: JavaFX dashboard with real-time updates
- **Automated Deployment**: PowerShell scripts for complete system management

## 🚀 Ready to Run!

The Real-Time Fraud Detection System is complete and ready for use:

```powershell
# Start the complete distributed system
cd D:\ProgettiD\javaFxRealtimeFraudulentTransactions
.\scripts\run-all.ps1
```

### What You'll See:

1. **Kafka Infrastructure** starts (Zookeeper + Kafka Broker)
2. **Multiple PowerShell terminals** open for each service
3. **Transaction Simulator** begins generating stock trades
4. **Fraud Detection Service** starts analyzing transactions
5. **JavaFX UI** opens showing real-time fraud alerts and transaction data

### System Architecture Flow:

```
📊 AlpacaTransactionSimulator
    ↓ (publishes to 'transactions' topic)
🔄 Kafka Message Broker
    ↓ (consumes from 'transactions' topic)
🔍 FraudDetectionService
    ↓ (publishes to 'fraud-alerts' & 'valid-transactions' topics)
🖥️ JavaFX Dashboard (subscribes to both alert topics)
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Testing

1. **Start System**: Run `.\scripts\run-all.ps1`
2. **Monitor JavaFX UI**: Watch real-time transactions and fraud alerts
3. **Observe Patterns**: Notice how fraud detection rules trigger alerts
4. **Test Scenarios**: Let system run to see various fraud patterns
5. **Stop System**: Run `.\scripts\stop-all.ps1` when done

## 🎯 Project Achievement

✅ **Complete distributed fraud detection system implemented**
✅ **Kafka-based microservices architecture**
✅ **Real-time transaction processing and visualization**
✅ **Local simulation of production-like environment**
✅ **Automated deployment and management scripts**

The system successfully demonstrates:

- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Real-time stream processing
- Fraud detection algorithms
- JavaFX desktop application development
- Distributed system orchestration on Windows

**🎉 Your Real-Time Fraud Detection System is ready for action!**
